##### For more information, see [this blog post](https://sinaahmadi.github.io/resources/zzahaccorpus.html).
---

This repository provides a corpus for two endangered languages of the [Zaza-Gorani language family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaza%E2%80%93Gorani_languages): [Zazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaza%E2%80%93Gorani_languages) and [Gorani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorani_language). These two languages along with [Shabaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabaki_language) are the three languages belonging to the Zaza-Gorani language family and are popularly believed to belong to [Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_languages). In [this paper](https://sinaahmadi.github.io/docs/articles/ahmadi2020zazagorani.pdf), we discuss how these languages are different from Kurdish, particularly the [Sorani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorani) and [Kurmanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurmanji) dialects, in terms of phonetics, morphology and syntax.

We also report our efforts in collecting documents in various topics from news websites andcreate the first corpus for Zazaki and Gorani.  We believe that this corpus can pave the way for furtherdevelopments in linguistics and computer science, particularly in information retrieval and NLP wherelanguage modeling is beneficial to various applications such as grammatical and spell checkin
